We've interpreted the junction rule (sec.~\ref{sec:junction-rule}, p.~\pageref{sec:junction-rule})
as a statement of conservation of
charge, but this interpretation only works if we assume that no charge
ever gets stashed away temporarily at some location in the circuit and
then brought back into action later. By analogy, the junction rule can
be disobeyed by cars, if there are lots of cars coming into a parking
garage in the morning and staying there all day until they leave after
working hours. Circuits can actually accumulate charge, e.g., on the
plates of a capacitor, so we would like to have a more general way of
describing conservation of charge (which is always true) than the
junction rule (which is only sometimes true).

    %q{The mass of water is conserved.}

%>
<% end_marg %>

By the way, this kind of thing arises in many physical situations, not just in electricity and
magnetism.  In figure \figref{faucet},
the stream of water is fatter near the mouth of the
faucet, and skinnier lower down. This is because the water speeds up as
it falls. If the cross-sectional area of the stream was equal all
along its length, then the rate of flow (kilograms per second) through
a lower cross-section would be greater than the rate of flow through a
cross-section higher up. Since the flow is \emph{steady}, the amount of water
between the two cross-sections stays constant. Conservation of mass
therefore requires that the cross-sectional area of the stream shrink
in inverse proportion to the increasing speed of the falling water.
Notice how we had to assume a \emph{steady} flow, so that no region
of space had any net influx or outflow of water.

The first step in formulating this sort of thing mathematically for
electric charge and currents is to recognize that we're describing
a law of physics --- conservation of charge --- and the
laws of physics are really always \emph{local}. This means that the
electric current, $I$, in units of amperes, is fundamentally ill suited
to our purposes, since the definition of current involves the net charge
flowing across some surface, which can be large. We want some way of talking
about the flow of current at a particular \emph{point} in space, which
would be a kind of current \emph{density} and should be a vector. The mathematical
setup is the same as as the one occurring in the definition of flux (sec.~\ref{sec:gauss-global},
p.~\pageref{flux-defined}), but with different variables. The current through an
infinitesimal area, with area vector $\der\vc{A}$, is
\begin{equation*}
  \der I = \vc{j}\cdot\der\vc{A},
\end{equation*}
which implicitly defines the current density $\vc{j}$. Integrating this gives
the current through a finite surface, $I=\int \vc{j}\cdot\der\vc{A}$, which looks
just like our definition of flux, but with different letters of the alphabet and
a different physical interpretation. The current density has SI units of $\zu{A}/\munit^2$.
It is a vector pointing in the net direction of flow of electric charge, with the flow
of negative charge being represented by a vector in the opposite direction.

\begin{eg}{Current density in a copper wire}
\egquestion Electrical codes in the U.S.~require that a copper wire carrying 20 A
should be at least of a certain size (called 12 gauge),
which has a cross-sectional area of $3.31\ \zu{mm}^2$. What is the corresponding
current density, assuming that the current is uniformly distributed across the
wire's entire cross-section?

\eganswer Since the current density
is stated to be constant, we can take it outside the integral,
$I=\int \vc{j}\cdot\der\vc{A}=\vc{j}\cdot\int \vc{A}=\vc{j}\cdot\vc{A}$.
The cross-sectional area is stated for a cross-section perpendicular to the
wire, so that the area vector points along the wire's axis, and therefore
$\vc{j}$ and $\vc{A}$ are parallel, meaning that the dot product $\vc{j}\cdot\vc{A}$
is simply the product of the magnitudes $jA$. We then have
\begin{align*}
  j &= \frac{I}{A} \\
    &= 6.0\times10^6\ \zu{A}/\munit^2.
\end{align*}
Comparing with the requirements in the code for other amounts of current, we find that the area is
required to scale up somewhat faster than the current, so that the current density has to be somewhat smaller
for thicker wires. This is presumably because a thicker wire has a smaller surface-to-volume ratio,
and therefore cannot get rid of its heat as quickly.

We can now imagine a ``div-meter'' (figure \figref{divmeter}, p.~\pageref{fig:divmeter})
that measures the divergence of the current density rather than the divergence of
the electric field. If $\operatorname{div}\vc{j}$ is nonzero --- let's say positive --- at a certain
point, then either conservation of charge is being violated at that point, or
charge that was stored in that location is being taken out, like the cars in the
parking garage leaving at the end of the day. Conservation of charge can now be stated
succinctly as
\begin{equation*}
  \operatorname{div}\vc{j} = -\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t},
\end{equation*}
where $\rho$ is the charge density. An equation of this form also holds in other
physical cases such as the flow of water, and is known more generally as an equation
of continuity.

\begin{eg}{Skin depth}\label{eg:skin-depth}
There is a general phenomenon in AC circuits that the flow of current
in a wire is nonuniform: the current density is higher as we get closer to the surface
of the wire. This is referred to as the ``skin effect,'' and it occurs because of
induced electric fields. Figure \figref{skin-depth} shows a typical profile of current
density throughout a wire. If we visualize a div-meter in this field, we can see that
although it would tend to spin and be swept downstream, it would not change its volume,
which is how a div-meter registers a divergence. Therefore 
$\operatorname{div}\vc{j}=0$ in this example, and by conservation of charge
we find that $\partial\rho/\partial t=0$, i.e., charge is not being stored or taken
out of storage anywhere in the wire. Skin depth is discussed further in example \ref{eg:skin-depth-maxwell}, p.~\pageref{eg:skin-depth-maxwell}.

\begin{eg}{Possible and impossible patterns of steady flow}\label{eg:possible-and-impossible-flows}
For a steady flow of electric charge, nothing is changing over time, so
$\partial\rho/\partial t=0$ and therefore the continuity equation
requires $\operatorname{div}\vc{j}=0$ everywhere:
the flow must be divergence-free. Figure \figref{div-focusing} shows some possible and impossible
examples.

Example \subfigref{div-focusing}{1} is impossible. The current density is of the form
$\vc{j}=bx\hat{\vc{x}}$, with $b>0$, and we showed in example \ref{eg:div-examples}, p.~\pageref{eg:div-examples},
that such a field has a divergence equal to $b$, which is nonzero.

The flow in \subfigref{div-focusing}{2} is also impossible. This is like $\vc{j}=-by\hat{\vc{y}}$,
which can be obtained from \subfigref{div-focusing}{1} by rotating 90 degrees and then reversing
all the vectors. Because the divergence is a scalar, the 90-degree rotation doesn't change the divergence.
The divergence is also a \emph{linear} operator (like any kind of derivative operator), so flipping
the arrows works like $\operatorname{div}(-\vc{j})=-\operatorname{div}\vc{j}$, i.e., it flips the
sign of the result. We therefore find that the divergence of this flow is $-b$, and this is also
impossible for a steady flow.

The flow in figure \subfigref{div-focusing}{3} is the point-by-point vector sum of \subfigref{div-focusing}{1}
and \subfigref{div-focusing}{2}. Since the divergence is again a linear operator,
we have $\operatorname{div}(\vc{j}_1+\vc{j}_2)=\operatorname{div}\vc{j}_1+\operatorname{div}\vc{j}_2$.
But this is $b-b=0$, so this \emph{is} a possible steady flow of charges.

\begin{eg}{The einzel lens}\label{eg:einzel-lens}\index{Einzel lens}
Figure \figref{einzel-lens} shows a common electrostatic focusing
device called an einzel lens.  Einzel lenses are used to focus beams
of charged particles in, for example, scanning electron microscopes
and old-fashioned CRT video tubes. This one consists of three
cylindrical pieces of metal. The axes coincide, and run from left to
right in the figure, which shows a cross-sectional view. The two dark
lines on the left are the top and bottom of the left-hand cylinder,
and similarly in the middle and right.
The left and right cylinders
at ground, the middle at $\phi>0$.

As the electrons enter from the left side, they first
encounter strong electric fields when they reach the gap between the
left and middle cylinders. If we consider an electron at the top edge
of the beam, the field initially accelerates it and moves it away
from the axis, to point A. Continuing from A to B, the electron is slowed back down
and deflected toward a point on the right at which the beam reaches a
focus on the axis. 

In the approximation that the electrons have constant velocity as they went from A to B and then to the
focus, the beam forms a perfect cone, and its density varies as $1/r^2$, where $r$ is the
distance from the focus. This is a current density $\vc{j}$ identical in
form to the electric field of a point charge, and since we know that that
field has zero divergence, so does this $\vc{j}$. The physics is different from that of the faucet in figure \figref{faucet},
since the water is incompressible.

<% begin_sec("Transformation properties (optional)",nil,'j-transformation',{'optional'=>true}) %>

Clearly the values of $\rho$ and $\vc{j}$ depend on our frame of reference.
By analogy with the flow of water, if Huck and Jim are floating down the Mississippi River
on a raft, the current density is zero in their frame of reference. If this analogy were
to hold in detail, then we would expect, however, that $\rho$ would stay the same.
This turns out not to be true. The purpose of this optional section is to work out
the transformation properties of $\rho$ and $\vc{j}$ correctly. Some of the discussion
will only be understandable to the reader who has studied optional chapter \ref{ch:relativity}.

Suppose that in a certain frame of reference, a long, straight rod holds charge density
$\rho$ and carries a uniform current density $j_z$ in the longitudinal direction.
It will be surrounded by an electric field that is proportional to $\rho$, and a magnetic
field proportional to $j_z$. Even if you haven't read ch.~\ref{ch:relativity}, you know
that when we change frames of reference, we will have a new mix of electric and magnetic
fields. Therefore if we know the transformation of the electric and magnetic fields, we
can immediately infer the same transformation properties for $\rho$ and $j_z$. We have
worked out the transformation of the fields on p.~\pageref{transformation-e-b}, so we
obtain the transformation of $\rho$ and $j_z$ simply by swapping in the new variables
and putting in factors of $c$ to make the units work:
\begin{align*}\label{transformation-e-b}
  c\rho' &=  \quad \mygamma c\rho - \frac{v}{c}\mygamma j_z  \\
  j_z' &= -\frac{v}{c}\mygamma c\rho + \mygamma j_z .
\end{align*}
Because $\rho$ and $\vc{j}$ are things we can measure at a point in space, they have
their own independent physical existence, and therefore these relationships hold regardless
of whether the physical context is the one involving the straight rod.\index{current density!transformation of}

\begin{eg}{Length contraction}
Suppose that in a certain frame of reference, a wire carries zero current but has a charge.
Setting $j_z=0$ in the equation above for $\rho'$ gives $\rho'=\mygamma\rho$. This is
the result of relativistic length contraction (sec.~\ref{subsec:length-contraction},
p.~\pageref{subsec:length-contraction}).

In sec.~\ref{sec:maxwell-vacuum} we studied Maxwell's equations in a vacuum. Now we wish to
generalize them to their full form, including the possibility that there are both charges
and currents. We've already seen in sec.~\ref{sec:gauss-div} how to incorporate a charge
density $\rho$, which acts as a source of electric fields. The only finishing touch left
is to add a term describing how a current density $\vc{j}$ produces a curly magnetic field.
We first present Maxwell's equations (also summarized for convenience
on p.~\pageref{fig:maxwell-summary}) and then give some justification. They are:
\begin{align*}\index{Maxwell's equations!full version}
  \operatorname{div}\vc{E} &=  4\pi k\rho \\
  \operatorname{div}\vc{B} &=  0 \\
  \operatorname{curl}\vc{E} &=  -\frac{\partial\vc{B}}{\partial t} \\
  \operatorname{curl}\vc{B} &=  \frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial\vc{E}}{\partial t}+\frac{4\pi k}{c^2}\vc{j}.
\end{align*}
The only new feature is the final term involving $\vc{j}$. 
Something like this is required physically because we know that currents create magnetic fields.
The $k/c^2$ has to be there because of units. The positive sign of this term expresses the
right-hand relationship between the direction of the current and the curliness of the magnetic field
it creates, which was proved in \notewithoutbackref{slope-is-v}. (If aliens on another planet define
their magnetic field to be the opposite direction compared to ours, then they can flip all the signs
of terms involving $\vc{B}$, but they have to do so in a consistent way.)
The only thing left to justify is the factor of $4\pi$, which we'll come back to after example \ref{eg:wire-field-checkerboard}.

\begin{eg}{The field surrounding a wire}\label{eg:wire-field-checkerboard}
The figure shows the magnetic field in a region of space near a long, straight, current-carrying wire.
A checkerboard grid is superimposed. The wire is three squares to the left of the figure, and its current
is coming out of the page. We found the form of this field in example \ref{eg:field-of-wire}, p.~\pageref{eg:field-of-wire}:
its magnitude falls off like $1/r$, and the field lines are circles.

Many people looking casually at this diagram would say that it has a nonzero curl that is out of the page
(meaning, by the right-hand rule, counterclockwise as seen from the front). But this has to be wrong, because according to Maxwell's equations,
$\operatorname{curl}\vc{B}$ is proportional to the current density $\vc{j}$ that exists \emph{here}, in this
region of space. The wire isn't here, it's over to the left, so here $\vc{j}=0$, and according to Maxwell, the curl of the field
should be zero here.

A closer inspection shows that it is indeed plausible that the curl is zero. Suppose we put a curl-meter (p.~\pageref{curl-meter}) on
top of the diagram. For simplicity, let's approximate the effect on the curl-meter by concentrating on four of the squares:
top-middle, bottom-middle, right-center, and left-center. The fields in the top-middle and bottom-middle squares
create counterclockwise torques, i.e., a torque vector in the direction out of the page.
However, the upward field in the center-left square is stronger than the one in the
center-right square, and this imbalance creates a countervailing torque that is clockwise, i.e., into the page.
It's not visually obvious that these torques exactly cancel, but it's plausible.
\end{eg}

Returning to the factor of $4\pi$, a nice way to verify this, which is
fundamentally of more physical interest than the $4\pi$ itself, is to show that Maxwell's equations
imply conservation of charge. The $4\pi$ then arises as the correct factor to put
in so that charge conservation comes out correctly. 
This can be done in the following vector calculus
calculation, which requires almost no real knowledge of vector calculus other than understanding generic
ideas about the linearity of derivatives. 
You can skip ahead to sec.~\ref{subsec:maxwell-round-up} if this kind of thing doesn't seem exciting.

We take the divergence of both sides of the fourth Maxwell's equation:
\begin{equation*}
  \operatorname{div}(\operatorname{curl}\vc{B}) =  
        \operatorname{div}\left[\frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial\vc{E}}{\partial t}+\frac{4\pi k}{c^2}\vc{j}\right].
\end{equation*}
The left side is zero by symmetry (\note{div-of-curl-is-zero}). On the right-hand side, we can
use the fact that the divergence is a kind of derivative, so it's linear, just like with a
plain old derivative, which has $(c_1f+c_2g)'=c_1f'+c_2g'$. This gives
\begin{equation*}
  0 = \operatorname{div}\frac{\partial\vc{E}}{\partial t}+4\pi k\operatorname{div} \vc{j}.
\end{equation*}
In general it's legitimate to swap the order of derivative operators
(\note{order-of-derivatives}), so we can make this into
\begin{equation*}
  0 = \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\operatorname{div}\vc{E}+4\pi k\operatorname{div} \vc{j}.
\end{equation*}
But now the first Maxwell's equation $\operatorname{div}\vc{E}=4\pi k\rho$ allows us to make this
into
\begin{equation*}
  0 = \frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t}+\operatorname{div} \vc{j},
\end{equation*}
which is the equation of continuity, stating that charge is conserved.
<% end_sec('maxwell-current') %>

<% begin_sec("The view from the top of the mountain",nil,'maxwell-round-up') %>
In a similar way, it is also possible to show from Maxwell's equations
that energy is conserved, a result known as Poynting's theorem.  The
basic concept is the same as in sec.~\ref{subsec:poynting}, where we
showed that the Poynting vector could be interpreted as a rate of
energy flow, but extending it to apply more generally than in the case of
a plane wave in vacuum.\label{maxwell-logic-roundup} Way back at the beginning of
ch.~\ref{ch:radiation},
p.~\pageref{maxwell-logic-promise}, I claimed that we would eventually
lay out the full set of tightly interlocking logical relationships
behind Maxwell's equations. Here's how that works.  The logical
development up until now has been the following:

\begin{tabular}{lp{80mm}}
  Assumptions: & 1.~Time is relative (sec.~\ref{sec:time}, p.~\pageref{sec:time}).\\
               & 2.~All frames of reference are equally valid, regardless of their motion how we orient them.\\
               & 3.~Charge is conserved.\\
               & 4.~Energy is conserved.\\
               & 5.~Electric and magnetic fields have some basic properties (observability, vectors, and
                 superposition --- sec.~\ref{sec:fields-basic-properties},
                 p.~\pageref{sec:fields-basic-properties}). \\
  Results:     & 6.~Maxwell's equations\\
               & 7.~$E=mc^2$ (sec.~\ref{sec:mass-energy-equivalence}, p.~\pageref{sec:mass-energy-equivalence}) \\
               & 8.~Time dilation, length contraction, and other facts about the structure of space
                    and time (sec.~\ref{sec:spacetime}, p.~\pageref{sec:spacetime}).
\end{tabular}

On the other hand, we can see that it's possible to run the logic in the opposite
direction as well. If we consider Maxwell's equations to be a starting assumption
(originally deduced by Maxwell from experimentalists' observations), then we can
deduce facts such as conservation of charge. Historically, the
idea of Einstein's two ground-breaking 1905 papers on relativity was to show that,
starting from facts 2-6 as assumptions, he could prove facts 1, 7, and 8.

Adding the final current term to Maxwell's equations means that we know enough laws
of physics that it should be possible, in principle, to predict the magnetic field
made by a set of currents, as in the doorbell ringer on p.~\pageref{ch:b-superpos}.
A seemingly reasonable approach would be to break down the wire into short segments,
like a dot-to-dot puzzle, find the field of one such segment, and then add up the fields
of all the segments. This divide-and-conquer technique would then reduce the hard problem
to the easier problem of finding the magnetic field created by a current distribution like the
one in figure \figref{out-of-nowhere}.

The trouble here is that the laws of physics can't predict the magnetic field in this
situation, because the laws of physics forbid this situation from happening. Although
the total amount of charge in the figure is staying constant, charge is springing into
existence on the left and disappearing into nothingness on the right. If Maxwell's equations
are true, then the continuity equation is true as well, and the continuity equation is a
\emph{local} law of physics: it forbids us from creating or destroying charge in one place,
even if we try to make up for it somewhere else.

To get the strict proportionality in Ohm's law, with no nonlinearity for an idealized ohmic material, we must
have $\vc{j}=\sigma\vc{E}$, for some constant of proportionality $\sigma$, called the conductivity. This
is the local form of Ohm's law.

The conducticity depends on the material, and generally tells us how many free charge carriers are available,
as well as the frequency of collisions that stop the charge carriers.
For a perfect conductor, the conductivity is infinite, but electric fields are excluded, so the product $\sigma\vc{E}$
becomes the indeterminate form $\infty\cdot 0$.
The units of conductivity can be expressed as $1/(\Omega\unitdot\munit)$. An example of a good conductor is
copper, which has $\sigma\approx 6\times10^7\ \Omega^{-1}\unitdot\munit^{-1}$.

\begin{eg}{Skin depth's dependence on frequency}\label{eg:skin-depth-maxwell}
Figure \figref{skin-depth2} is a copy of the one from example \ref{eg:skin-depth}, p.~\pageref{eg:skin-depth},
in which we said that the arrows represented the current density, and used the equation of continuity to
find out that $\partial\rho/\partial t=0$, i.e., charge is not being stored or taken
out of storage anywhere in the wire. We can now use Maxwell's equations to see why this phenomenon occurs only for AC circuits.

By $\vc{j}=\sigma\vc{E}$, we see that the figure can be taken as a drawing of either the current or the electric field.
The only difference would be the constant scalar factor $\sigma$, which is irrelevant since we haven't defined a numerical scale
for the length of the arrows. The figure shows a pretty strong skin depth effect, but we could imagine making it either stronger
or weaker than this. If it were much stronger, then appreciable fields and currents would exist only near the surface, like a skin. If it were
much weaker, or nonexistent, then we would see a nearly uniform condition throughout the cross-section of the wire. We will
argue that the effect must depend on the \emph{frequency} of the current. In some common examples from everyday life,
this frequency is zero for a DC circuit such as a flashlight, 60 Hz for most household appliances in the US,
and $\sim1\ \zu{GHz}$ for a cell phone. In the case of 60 Hz, the current is switching directions back and forth 60 times per second,
with a sinusoidal variation.

We apply the following two Maxwell's equations:
\begin{align*}
  \operatorname{curl}\vc{E} &=  -\frac{\partial\vc{B}}{\partial t} \\
  \operatorname{curl}\vc{B} &=  \frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial\vc{E}}{\partial t}+\frac{4\pi k}{c^2}\vc{j}.
\end{align*}
In the DC limit, all the time derivatives must vanish, and therefore $\operatorname{curl}\vc{E}=0$. If we imagine
inserting a curl-meter for the electric field into figure \figref{skin-depth2}, we can see that a skin depth effect
requires a nonzero $\operatorname{curl}\vc{E}$. Therefore the skin effect cannot occur at DC, i.e., the skin depth $\delta$
goes to infinity as the frequency $f$ approaches zero. A more detailed analysis shows that
$\delta\propto f^{-1/2}$. Since the only unitful quantities available are
$\sigma$, $f$, and the fundamental constants $k$ and $c$, units then require $\delta\propto(\sigma\ f k)^{-1/2}c$.

Example \ref{eg:out-of-nowhere}, p.~\pageref{eg:out-of-nowhere}, shows that if we want to
find the field made by a current distribution like the one in the doorbell ringer, we can't
necessarily chop up the current distribution into building blocks that look like little
line segments. Let's instead investigate magnetic dipoles as building blocks.

<% begin_sec("Modeling the dipole using a current loop",nil,'b-dipole-current-loop') %>
Our discussion of the dipole in sec.~\ref{sec:dipole}, p.~\pageref{sec:dipole}, focused mainly
on the electric dipole. Here we discuss the magnetic dipole in more detail. We've defined
two types of dipoles in terms of the energy they have when they interact with an external field,
\begin{align*}
  U &= -\vc{D}\cdot\vc{E} \qquad \text{[definition of the electric dipole moment $\vc{D}$]}\\
  U &= -\vc{m}\cdot\vc{B} \qquad \text{[definition of the magnetic dipole moment $\vc{m}$]},
\end{align*}
and the perfect mathematical analogy between the two definitions automatically implies that
electric and magnetic dipoles have many of the same properties. Both dipole moments are measured by vectors,
and this implies that they behave as vectors when we rotate them, and also that they add like
vectors.

But this is somewhat abstract, and it's nice to have a more concrete
physical picture in mind.  Because our universe doesn't seem to come
equipped with magnetic charges, we can't make a magnetic dipole by
gluing such charges to the ends of a stick. Instead, the simplest
embodiment of a magnetic dipole would be something like the current
loop shown in figure \figref{current-loop}.  Figure
\figref{adddipoles} shows an example of why it makes sense that dipole
moments add as vectors, and that the dipole moment is proportional to
the area of the loop.
In exercise \label{lab:currents-and-magnetic-fields}, p.~\pageref{lab:currents-and-magnetic-fields}, we will
verify using the right-hand
rule that the torque in figure \figref{squaretorque-fac} is in the direction
that tends to align the dipole vector with the magnetic field. A calculation
(\note{b-dipole-torque}) shows that the dipole moment is
\begin{equation*}
  \vc{m}=I\vc{A},
\end{equation*}
where $I$ is the current and $\vc{A}$ is the area vector.

Figure \subfigref{twisted-pair}{1} shows a pair of wires that could be used as part of
a complete DC circuit. Let's say that current is flowing to the right through the black
wire and then later on comes back to the left through the white one. Each wire will
to create a magnetic field, and this can cause interference in other circuitry. Although
there will be a tendency for the two fields to cancel, the cancellation will not be
perfect, because at a given point in space, the two fields will not be exactly the same
strength or exactly opposite in direction.

Figure \subfigref{twisted-pair}{2} shows a way to reduce the interference. The two
wires are twisted around one another. An idealized version of this setup is shown
in \subfigref{twisted-pair}{3}, where we have a chain of circular current loops.
The direction of the current alternates between clockwise and counterclockwise.
Therefore, \subfigref{twisted-pair}{4}, the magnetic dipole moments of the loops
tend to cancel out. Mathematically, we have $\vc{m}=I\vc{A}$, and by the right-hand
rule, successive $\vc{A}$ vectors are up and then down.

\begin{eg}{The magnetic dipole moment of an atom}\label{eg:estimate-atomic-dipole}
Let's make an order-of-magnitude estimate of the magnetic dipole moment of an atom.
A hydrogen atom is about $10^{-10}$ m in diameter, and the electron moves at speeds
of about $10^{-2} c$. We don't know the shape of the orbit, and indeed it turns out that
according to the principles of quantum mechanics, the electron doesn't even have a well-defined
orbit, but if we're brave, we can still estimate the dipole moment using the
cross-sectional area of the atom, which will be on the order of 
$(10^{-10}\ \zu{m})^2=10^{-20}\ \zu{m}^2$.
The electron is a single particle, not a steady current, but again we throw caution to
the winds, and estimate the current it creates as $e/\Delta t$,
where $\Delta t$, the time for one orbit, can be estimated by dividing the
size of the atom by the electron's velocity. (This is only a rough estimate,
and we don't know the shape of the orbit, so it would be silly, for instance,
to bother with multiplying the diameter by $\pi$ based on our intuitive visualization
of the electron as moving around the circumference of a circle.)
The result for the dipole moment is $m\sim10^{-23}\ \zu{A}\unitdot\zu{m}^2$. 

Should we
be impressed with how small this dipole moment is, or with how big it is, considering
that it's being made by a single atom? 
Very large or very small numbers are never very interesting by themselves. To get a
feeling for what they mean, we need to compare them to something else. An interesting
comparison here is to think in terms of the total number of atoms in a typical object,
which might be on the order of $10^{26}$ (Avogadro's number). Suppose we had this
many atoms, with their moments all aligned. The total dipole moment would be on the
order of $10^3\ \zu{A}\unitdot\zu{m}^2$, which is a pretty big number. To get
a dipole moment this strong using human-scale devices,
we'd have to send a thousand amps of current through a
one-square meter loop of wire! The insight to be gained here is that, even in
a permanent magnet, we must not have all the atoms perfectly aligned, because that
would cause more spectacular magnetic effects than we really observe. Apparently, nearly
all the atoms in such a magnet are oriented randomly, and do not contribute to the
magnet's dipole moment.
\end{eg}


<% end_sec('b-dipole-current-loop') %>
<% begin_sec("Dipole moment related to angular momentum",nil,'g-factor') %>\index{$g$ factor}

In example \ref{eg:estimate-atomic-dipole} we made a crude estimate of the typical
magnetic dipole moment of an atom. There is another way of going about this,
which is potentially much more accurate and of interest as a way of probing the structure
of the atom.

Suppose that a particle of charge $q$
and mass $m$ is whizzing around and around some closed path. We don't
even care whether the trajectory is a square or a circle, an orbit or a random wiggle.
But let's say for convenience that it's a planar shape. The magnetic
dipole moment (averaged over time) is $\vc{m}=I\vc{A}$. But the angular
momentum of a unit mass can also be interpreted as twice the area it sweeps out per unit time.
Aside from the factor of two, which is just a historical glitch in the definitions,
this mathematical analogy is exact: mass is to
charge as angular momentum $\vc{L}$ is to magnetic dipole moment $\vc{m}$. Therefore we
have the identity
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{q}{m}\cdot\frac{|\vc{L}|}{|\vc{m}|} = 2
\end{equation*}
(where $\vc{m}$ is the dipole moment, while $m$ is the mass). The left-hand side
is called the $g$ factor.\index{g factor} We expect $g=2$
for a single orbiting particle.

Now suppose that we have a collection of particles with identical values of $q/m$. Then vector addition of the $\vc{L}$ and $\vc{m}$ values
gives the same $g=2$ for the system as a whole. On the other hand, if the different
members of the system do \emph{not} all have the same $q/m$, then the $g$ of the system
as a whole need not be 2. For example, a collection of positive and negative charges
could easily have zero net charge but $\vc{m}\ne0$, giving $g=0$.

Particles such as the electron, the neutron, and the proton may be pointlike, or they
may be composites of other particles.
The electon and proton, which are charged, have the expected $g$ factors
of exactly 2 when we measure the $\vc{L}$ and $\vc{m}$ that they have due
to their motion through space. But we also find that electrons, neutrons, and protons all come equipped
with a built-in angular momentum, present even when they are at rest.
This intrinsic angular momentum, called spin,\index{spin}
is fixed in magnitude but can vary in direction, like that of a gyroscope.
Thus if we measure the $\vc{L}$ and $\vc{m}$ of these particles 
\emph{at rest}, they have fixed $g$ factors, figure \figref{g-factors}.

    }}
  )
%>
<% end_marg %>

The electron's intrinsic $g$ factor is extremely close to 2, and if we ignore the small discrepancy for
now, we are led to imagine that the electron is either a pointlike particle or a composite
of smaller particles, each of which has the same charge-to-mass ratio. The neutron does have a
nonvanishing dipole moment, so its zero $g$ factor suggests that it is a composite of other
particles whose charges cancel. The proton's $g$ factor is quite different from 2, so we
infer that it, too, is composite. The current theory is that protons and neutrons
are clusters of particles called quarks.\index{quark} Quarks come in different types,
and the different types have different values of $q/m$.

The magnetic dipole moment of the proton is of considerable importance in our lives because
of its use in the MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans used in medicine.
As described on p.~\pageref{fig:mri}, a large DC magnetic field, generated by
superconducing magnets, is used to cause the protons in the body's hydrogen
atoms to align partially (about $10^{-5}$ of full alignment). These magnetic
moments are then manipulated and observed using AC fields.

From a physicist's point of view, it is also remarkable that we can infer these facts about the internal
structures of neutrons and protons without having to do any
experiments that directly probe their interior structure.  We don't
need a super-powerful microscope, nor do we need a particle
accelerator that can supply enough energy to shake up their internal
structure, like shaking a gift-wrapped box to tell what's inside.
Merely by measuring the external, aggregate properties of the ``box,''
we can get clues about the structure inside.\footnote{This is closely analogous
to the Tolman-Stewart experiment (example \ref{eg:tolman-stewart},
p.~\pageref{eg:tolman-stewart}), in which the subatomic structure of
metals was probed by measuring inertial effects in an electric
circuit.}

is the angle between the dipole vector and the line connecting the dipole to this
point, and $E_z$ and $E_R$ are, respectively, the components of the field
parallel to and perpendicular to the dipole vector. We have already found this field in
the special cases of $\theta=\pi/2$ (example \ref{eg:e-dipole-mid-plane},

Many real-world electromagnets are built out of multiple circular loops of wire. In this section
we use a trick to calculate the useful result for the field at the center of
a single circular loop. Usually I'm not a big fan of tricks, but we'll see later
that this trick can be generalized in a useful way.

    %q{Two counterrotating rings of current. The inset photo 2 shows a twin lead cable with the insulation
       stripped off of its ends.}
  )
%>
<% end_marg %>

We start by considering a problem, figure \subfigref{counterrotating}{1},
that looks harder but is actually easier. We have not one but two loops of wire, with
slightly different radii $r$ and $r+\der r$. Here the ``d'' just means ``a little bit of,''
i.e., writing the radii this way is just a way of saying that they're almost, but not quite, the same.
The currents in the two rings are both $I$, but they flow in opposite directions. This is actually a reasonably
realistic setup; the inset \subfigref{counterrotating}{2} shows a type of cable,
called ``twin lead,'' that is often used in this way, with current flowing one way through one
conductor and then coming back through the other conductor in the opposite direction.
Of course in the real circuit we would have to have a battery and connections to the loops from the outside,
and we would probably hook up the two loops in series so that their currents were guaranteed to be
exactly equal in absolute value. These complications are not shown in the diagram.


The trick, as shown in \subfigref{counterrotating}{3}, is to take the circular strip between the
rings and break it up into imaginary squares, then place a square current loop with current $I$ on each one.
These are all dipoles, and each one contributes a field at the center which we can calculate
by plugging $\theta=\pi/2$ in to our expressions from section \ref{subsec:dipole-field}. The result is that
each tiny dipole $\der m$ contributes $-(k/c^2r^3)\der m$, where the minus sign means that the field
points out of the page (in the opposite direction compared to the vector $\der\vc{m}$). The total
field is found by adding up all these small contributions to the field,
\begin{equation*}
  B = -\int \frac{k}{c^2r^3} \der m.
\end{equation*}
This integral, like any integral, represents a sum of infinitely many infinitesimal things.
We're not integrating with respect to some variable $m$, though; $\der m$ here just means an infinitesimal
dipole moment of one of the squares. But we don't actually need any calculus to do this integral.
Moving all the constants outside and substituting $\der m=I\der A$, we have
\begin{equation*}
  B = -\frac{kI}{c^2r^3} \int \der A,
\end{equation*}
where $\int\der A$ is the area of the strip,
$A=(\text{width})(\text{circumference})=(\der r)(2\pi r)$. Our final result is
\begin{equation*}
  B = -\frac{2\pi kI}{c^2r^2} \der r \qquad \text{[field at the center of figure \subfigref{counterrotating}{1}]}.
\end{equation*}

We weren't actually that excited about finding the field in the somewhat artificial example
of figure \figref{counterrotating}. What would be more useful would be to find the field of
a \emph{single} circular loop. Now we just play a similar trick again. We imagine an infinite
set of concentric rings, extending from some radius $a$ all the way out to infinity. The current
on the outer edge of each ring is canceled out by the current in the overlapping inner edge of
the next ring, so that the only loop of current that \emph{doesn't} cancel out is the very 
innermost one, at $r=a$. The result is then that the field at the center of a circular loop
is $\int_a^\infty [-(2\pi kI)/(c^2 r^2)]\der r$, or
\begin{equation*}
  B = \frac{2\pi kI}{c^2a} \qquad \text{[field at the center of a ring of current]}.
\end{equation*}
The positive sign means that the direction of the field is right-handed, e.g., out of the page
if the current is counterclockwise.

Here $r$ is the distance from the center of the wire. The field vectors trace
circles in planes perpendicular to the wire, in a direction given by a right-hand
rule where the thumb is the current and the fingers are the field. The form
of this result was derived in example \ref{eg:field-of-wire}, p.~\pageref{eg:field-of-wire},
and the unitless factor of 2 in example \ref{eg:b-wire}, p.~\pageref{eg:b-wire}.

The field vectors form a dipole-like pattern, coming through the loop and back
around on the outside. The orientation of the loops is such that in the middle
region there is a right-hand relationship in which the thumb is the field; or, alternatively,
one can use the same right-hand rule as for a straight wire, applying it to the area
close to the wire.
There is no simple equation for a field at an arbitrary point in space, but
for a point lying \emph{along the central axis} perpendicular to the loop,
the field is
\begin{equation*}
  B = \frac{k}{c^2}\cdot 2\pi Ib^2\left(b^2+z^2\right)^{-3/2}\eqquad,
\end{equation*}
where $b$ is the radius of the loop and $z$ is the distance of the point
from the plane of the loop.

\noindent\textit{Field created by a solenoid (cylindrical coil):}\\
The field pattern is similar to that of a single loop, but for a long solenoid
the field lines become very straight on the inside of the coil
and on the outside immediately next to the coil. For a sufficiently long solenoid,
the interior field also becomes very nearly uniform (problem \ref{hw:naughty-solenoid}), with a magnitude of
\begin{equation*}\label{field-of-a-solenoid}
  B = \frac{k}{c^2}\cdot 4\pi I N/\ell\eqquad,
\end{equation*}
where $N$ is the number of turns of wire and $\ell$ is the length of the
solenoid. This result is derived in example \ref{eg:amperesolenoid}, p.~\pageref{eg:amperesolenoid}.
The field near the mouths or outside the coil is not constant, and
is more difficult to calculate (problem \ref{hw:finite-solenoid}). For a long solenoid, the exterior field is
much smaller than the interior field.\index{solenoid!magnetic field}

Some other cases of interest can be solved by superposing the fields

In sec.~\ref{sec:sum-dipoles}, p.~\pageref{sec:sum-dipoles}, we were able to find the magnetic
field at  the center of a current loop by the trick of turning the current distribution into
a superposition of small, square dipoles. It's usually a waste of time to learn a trick that
only works in one case, but this trick can be extended to apply more generally. Consider the
wire loop shown in figure \subfigref{potato-chip}{1}, which has a randomly chosen, asymmetric
shape like a potato chip. If it carries a steady current, it will create a static magnetic field pattern. (The
assumption of a steady current is necessary, since otherwise, e.g., it could act like an antenna
and radiate electromagnetic waves.)

<%
  fig(
    'potato-chip',
    %q{Extending the dipole trick to handle a randomly chosen, asymmetric current loop.}
  )
%>
<% end_marg %>

Figure \subfigref{potato-chip}{2} shows an idea for extending our
dipole trick to handle this case.  We form an imaginary tube that
starts on the loop and extends off to infinity, then split it up into
strips like railroad tracks, where each railroad track contains an
infinite number of square dipoles, \subfigref{potato-chip}{3}. The key
here is that although each track has a pair of long, straight rails
that bring current in from infinity and then send it back out, the
currents along these rails cancel when we overlay each track with its
neighbor. Therefore all we really need to do is find the magnetic
field of \emph{one} such semi-infinite strip, and by adding it up we
can find the field of an arbitrary object like the potato-chip loop. 

The field of such a strip is probably pretty complicated, and likely
to be mainly the field due to the two long rails. However, the
currents in the rails are destined to cancel out when we add
everything up, sort of like a politically opposed married couple who
vote in every election and cancel each other out --- they might as
well have stayed home. We therefore conjecture that the correct final
result can be found by adding up fields that depend only on the
properties of the little end-caps. This is not guaranteed to be
correct, for the reasons described in example \ref{eg:out-of-nowhere}
on p.~\pageref{eg:out-of-nowhere}, but let's go ahead based on this
questionable assumption and see where it gets us.

Given some point in space, we want to find the contribution to the field
at that point coming from a particular end-cap. Let the vector from the
end-cap to our point be $\vc{r}$. The contribution to the field
has to be of the form $\text{function}(\vc{j},\vc{r})\der v$, where
the $\der v$ is the volume of the wire constituting the end-cap.
The mystery function has to be proportional to its two vector inputs,
and as its output it has to give a vector with units of tesla. This
severely constrains the form of the function. The only rotationally
invariant way to combine two vectors like this is the cross product,
and the only way of getting the right units is by throwing in a factor
of $kc^{-2}r^{-3}$. The only wiggle room is a possible unitless factor
in front. This unitless factor turns out to be 1, which we will prove
later, in example \ref{eg:biot-savart-center-of-loop},
by comparing with a configuration whose field we already know.
So the contribution to the field from this end-cap is
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{k}{c^2} \frac{\vc{j}\times\vc{r}}{r^3}\der v.
\end{equation*}
Within the small volume of the end-cap, the integrand is constant,
and the end-cap is approximately straight, so that it forms a
cylinder with volume $\der v=\der A\der\ell$, where $\der A$ is the
cross-sectional area.
We also assume that, within this short segment of wire,
the current flows in the direction of the wire and is uniform across
the wire's cross-sectional area. This allows us to rewrite
the end-cap's field as
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{Ik}{c^2} \frac{\der\bell\times\vc{r}}{r^3}.
\end{equation*}
Integrating over the contributions of all the end-caps gives the formula
known as the Biot-Savart law (rhymes with ``Leo bazaar''),
\begin{equation*}
  \vc{B} = \frac{Ik}{c^2} \int\frac{\der\bell\times\vc{r}}{r^3}.
\end{equation*}

\begin{eg}{The field at the center of a circular loop}\label{eg:biot-savart-center-of-loop}
In section \ref{sec:sum-dipoles} we had to use a trick
to find the the field at the center
of a circular loop of current of radius $a$. The Biot-Savart law routinizes the trick
for us and eliminates the need for that kind of creativity. Dividing the loop
into many short segments, each $\der\bell$ is perpendicular to the 
$\vc{r}$ vector that goes from it to the center of the circle, and
every $\vc{r}$ vector has magnitude $a$. Therefore 
every cross product $\der\bell\times\vc{r}$ has the same magnitude,
$a\der \ell$, as well as the same direction along the axis perpendicular to the loop.
The field is
\begin{align*}
        B        &= \int \frac{ kIa\der \ell}{ c^2 a^3}\\
                &= \frac{ kI}{ c^2 a^2} \int \der \ell \\
                &= \frac{ kI}{ c^2 a^2} (2\pi a) \\
                &= \frac{2\pi kI}{ c^2 a}.
\end{align*}
\end{eg}

The fact that the field in example \ref{eg:biot-savart-center-of-loop} comes out the same as in the previous calculation verifies
that we have the right unitless factor in the Biot-Savart law.

Although the Biot-Savart law seems to have given us a correct result, we highlighted
an assumption in its derivation that was not guaranteed to be correct. To give
a full proof of the law, we would really need to prove that when we plug the
result back in to Maxwell's equations, it gives a solution. That unfortunately
requires a level of vector calculus beyond the scope of this book.

\begin{eg}{Out-of-the-plane field of a circular loop}\label{eg:biotloop}
\egquestion
What is the magnetic field of a circular loop of current at a point on the axis
perpendicular to the loop,  lying a distance $z$ from the loop's center?

\eganswer
Again, let's write $a$ for the loop's radius. The \vc{r} vector now has
magnitude $\sqrt{ a^2+ z^2}$, but it is still perpendicular to the $\der\bell$
vector. By symmetry, the only nonvanishing component of the field is along the $z$ axis,
\begin{align*}
         B_{z}        &= \int |\der\vc{B}|\:\zu{cos}\:\alpha\\
                &= \int \frac{ kI\,r\,\der \ell}{ c^2 r^3}\frac{ a}{ r}\\
                &= \frac{ kIa}{ c^2 r^3} \int \der \ell \\
                &= \frac{2\pi kIa^2}{ c^2( a^2+ z^2)^{3/2}}\eqquad.
\end{align*}
For $z=0$ we recover the result of example \ref{eg:biot-savart-center-of-loop}.
For $z\gg a$, the field is that of a dipole with the correct dipole moment (ex.~\ref{lab:currents-and-magnetic-fields},
p.~\pageref{lab:currents-and-magnetic-fields}).

\notetext{div-of-curl-is-zero}{Divergence of a curl}
\notesummary{The divergence of a curl is zero}
The kind of field that looks like it would have a nonvanishing value of this
operation is something like $\vc{F}=zx\hat{\vc{y}}$, the idea being that we take
a field like $x\hat{\vc{y}}$ that has a curl in the $z$ direction, and then we
give it some $z$ dependence so that there could be a divergence. In fact, any
field that is differentiable near the origin can have its components approximated in that neighborhood
by a function of this general form (a second-order mixed polynomial), so if we can prove
that $\operatorname{div}(\operatorname{curl}\vc{F})=0$ for this particular $\vc{F}$, it
follows that the div of a curl is zero for any $\vc{F}$.

Now we show based on symmetry that $\operatorname{div}(\operatorname{curl}\vc{F})=0$ for this $\vc{F}$.
Suppose we rotate our coordinate system by 180 degrees about the $y$ axis. 
This doesn't change the field or its components, but the curl
lies in the $x$-$z$ plane, so the output of the curl operation has its components sign-flipped
because of the new coordinate system used to describe it.
This is an over-all reversal of the curl's direction, and since
the div is linear, the effect is to sign-flip $\operatorname{div}(\operatorname{curl}\vc{F})$.

But the divergence is a scalar, so the final result of taking $\operatorname{div}(\operatorname{curl}\vc{F})$
cannot change just because we change our coordinates.

We have proved that $\operatorname{div}(\operatorname{curl}\vc{F})$ flips its sign, but also
that it doesn't change its sign. This is only possible if it is zero, as claimed.

\notetext{order-of-derivatives}{Order of derivatives}
\notesummary{Typically it's OK to freely interchange the order of derivative operations}
Of course an example doesn't prove a general rule, but let's consider a simple example in order
to get the idea of what is being discussed. We have
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial y}(xy)\right)
        = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}x = 1
\end{equation*}
but also
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{\partial}{\partial y} \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x}(xy)\right)
        = \frac{\partial}{\partial y}y = 1.
\end{equation*}
In this example, it didn't matter which derivative we applied first.
A theorem called Clairaut's theorem says that if a function $f(x,y)$ is well-behaved,
in the sense that all its second derivatives
($\partial^2f/\partial x^2$, $\partial(\partial f/\partial x)/\partial y$, and
$\partial(\partial f/\partial y)/\partial x$)
are continuous at a certain point, then the first derivatives can be interchanged at that point,
so that $\partial(\partial f/\partial x)/\partial y=\partial(\partial f/\partial y)/\partial x$.

Because derivative operators like div, grad, and curl can be expressed in terms of partial
derivatives, it follows that they can also be interchanged under the same conditions.

\notetext{b-dipole-torque}{Magnetic dipole moment of a current loop}
\notesummary{The magnetic dipole moment of a square current loop is given by $\vc{m}=I\vc{A}$.}

    {'suffix'=>2,'width'=>'narrow'}
  )
%>

Consider the
geometry shown in figure \figref{squaretorque-fac}.
Let the mobile charge carriers in the wire have linear
density $\lambda$, and
let the sides of the loop have
length $h$, so that we have $I=\lambda v$. We want to show that
$m=IA=h^2\lambda v$ is consistent with the definition of the dipole moment
$U=-\vc{m}\cdot\vc{B}$, where $\vc{B}$ is an externally applied field.
We do this by computing the torque and then finding the work done when
the dipole is reoriented.

The only nonvanishing torque comes from the forces on the
left and right sides. The currents in these sides are perpendicular to the field,
so the magnitude of the cross product $\vc{F}=q\vc{v}\times\vc{B}$ is simply
$|\vc{F}|=qvB$. The torque supplied by each of these forces
is $\vc{r}\times\vc{F}$, where the lever arm $\vc{r}$ has length $h/2$,
and makes an angle $\theta$ with respect to the force vector. The magnitude of the total torque
acting on the loop is therefore
\begin{align*}
  |\btau|        &=2\frac{h}{2}|\vc{F}|\sin\theta \\
                                  &=h\:qvB\:\sin\theta\eqquad,\\
         \intertext{and substituting $q=\lambda h$ and $v=m/h^2\lambda$, we have}
                  |\btau|        &= h\:\lambda h\:\frac{m}{h^2\lambda} B\sin\theta \\
                                  &=m B\sin\theta\eqquad.\\
\end{align*}
The work done to reorient the dipole is $W=\int \tau\der\theta=-mB\cos\theta$
(ignoring the irrelevant constant of integration), and this
is the same as $U=-\vc{m}\cdot\vc{B}$.

\begin{labgoal}
Measure the $q/m$ ratio of the electron.

Why should you believe electrons exist? By the turn of the
twentieth century, not all scientists believed in the
literal reality of atoms, and few could imagine smaller
objects from which the atoms themselves were constructed.
Over two thousand years had elapsed since the Greeks first
speculated that atoms existed based on philosophical
arguments without experimental evidence. During the Middle
Ages in Europe, ``atomism'' had been considered highly
suspect, and possibly heretical. Finally by the Victorian
era, enough evidence had accumulated from chemical
experiments to make a persuasive case for atoms, but
subatomic particles were not even discussed.

If it had taken two millennia to settle the question of
atoms, it is remarkable that another, subatomic level of
structure was brought to light over a period of only about
five years, from 1895 to 1900. Most of the crucial work was
carried out in a series of experiments by J.J. Thomson, who
is therefore often considered the discoverer of the electron.

<%
  fig(
    'lab-charge-to-mass',
    %q{The vacuum tube apparatus used in this lab.},
    {'width'=>'column','float'=>false}
  )
%>

In this lab, you will carry out a variation on a crucial
experiment by Thomson, in which he measured the ratio of the
charge of the electron to its mass, $q/m$. The basic idea is
to observe a beam of electrons in a region of space where
there is an approximately uniform magnetic field, B. The
electrons are emitted perpendicular to the field, and, it
turns out, travel in a circle in a plane perpendicular to
it. The force of the magnetic field on the electrons is
\begin{equation*}
      F  =  qvB \qquad ,  \qquad (1)  
\end{equation*}

directed towards the center of the circle. Their acceleration is
\begin{equation*}
      a  =  \frac{v^2}{r}  \qquad ,  \qquad  (2)  
\end{equation*}
so using $F=ma$, we can write
\begin{equation*}
      qvB  =  \frac{mv^2}{r} \qquad .  \qquad  (3)  
\end{equation*}
If the initial velocity of the electrons is provided by
accelerating them through a voltage difference $V$, they
have a kinetic energy equal to $qV$, so
\begin{equation*}
   \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = qV \qquad . \qquad   (4)
\end{equation*}
From equations 3 and 4, you can determine $q/m$. Note that
since the force of a magnetic field on a moving charged
particle is always perpendicular to the direction of the
particle's motion, the magnetic field can never do any work
on it, and the particle's KE and speed are therefore constant.

You will be able to see where the electrons are going,
because the vacuum tube is filled with a hydrogen gas at a
low pressure. Most electrons travel large distances through
the gas without ever colliding with a hydrogen atom, but a
few do collide, and the atoms then give off blue light,
which you can see. Although I will loosely refer to ``seeing
the beam,'' you are really seeing the light from the
collisions, not the beam of electrons itself. The manufacturer
of the tube has put in just enough gas to make the beam
visible; more gas would make a brighter beam, but would
cause it to spread out and become too broad to measure it precisely.

The field is supplied by an electromagnet consisting of two
circular coils, each with 130 turns of wire (the same on all
the tubes we have). The coils are placed on the same axis,
with the vacuum tube at the center. A pair of coils arranged
in this type of geometry are called Helmholtz coils. Such a
setup provides a nearly uniform field in a large volume of
space between the coils, and that space is more accessible
than the inside of a solenoid.

\labsection{Setup}

Heater circuit: As with all vacuum tubes, the cathode is
heated to make it release electrons more easily.
There is a separate low-voltage power supply built into
the high-voltage supply. It has a set of green plugs that, in different
combinations, allow you to get various low voltage values.
Use it to supply 6 V to the terminals
marked ``heater'' on the vacuum tube.
The tube should start to glow.

Electromagnet circuit: Connect the other DC power
supply, in series with an ammeter, to the terminals marked
``coil.'' The current from this power supply goes through
both coils to make the magnetic field. Verify that the
magnet is working by using it to deflect a nearby compass.

High-voltage circuit: 
Connect the high voltage supply to the
terminals marked ``anode.'' Ask your instructor to check
your circuit. Now plug in the HV supply and turn up the
voltage to 300 V. You should see the electron beam. If you
don't see anything, try it with the lights dimmed.

\labsection{Observations}

Make the necessary observations in order to find $q/m$,
carrying out your plan to deal with the effects of the
Earth's field. The high voltage is supposed to be 300 V,
but to get an accurate measurement of what it really is
you'll need to use a multimeter rather than the poorly
calibrated meter on the front of the high voltage supply.

The beam can be measured accurately by using the glass
rod inside the tube, which has a centimeter scale marked
on it.

Be sure to compute $q/m$ before you leave the lab. That way
you'll know you didn't forget to measure something
important, and that your result is reasonable compared to
the currently accepted value.

In section \ref{sec:sum-dipoles}, p.~\pageref{sec:sum-dipoles}, we used a trick to find

In this exercise you will use the same technique to find the field of a long, straight piece of
twin-lead cable, and then the field of a single, long, straight wire. This can the be checked against
the result of example \ref{eg:b-wire}, p.~\pageref{eg:b-wire}.

The figure shows the setup. The two conductors are separated by a distance $b$ which is small compared to $h$, and they extend infinitely
far to the left and right. We wish to find the field $B$ at the point indicated in the figure.
To start out with, we imagine, as in section \ref{sec:sum-dipoles}, dividing up the space between the conductors
into little rectangles, and we then set up an integral for the field in which we integrate over these tiny rectangles:
\begin{equation*}
  B = -\int \frac{k}{c^2r^3} \der m.
\end{equation*}

1. Use the relation $\der m=I\der A$ to make this into an integral over the area between the conductors.
Then let the width of each little rectangle be $\der x$, and make this into an integral over $x$.

\vspace{20mm}

2. This integral is not yet really a definite integral, because it has the parameter $h$ inside.
Change to a new, unitless variable $u=x/h$ and rewrite the result in terms of an actual definite integral,
with other parameters appearing outside the integral as a single multiplicative factor.

\vspace{20mm}

3. You should find that the definite integral has the form $\int_{-\infty}^\infty (1+u^2)^{-3/2}\der u$.
It's a waste of time to do an integral like this by hand. There is a nice piece of open-source software
called Maxima that can do this kind of thing. You can download it for free, but for now we'll find it
more convenient to use it through a web interface on a server, at \url{maxima.cesga.es}. 
Your definite integral will look like this: \texttt{integrate((1+u\textasciicircum{}2)\textasciicircum{}(-3/2),u,-inf,inf);} (note
the semicolon). Find its
value and complete the calculation of the field of the twin lead cable.
