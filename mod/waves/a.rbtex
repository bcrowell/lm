This type of physics course can easily seem to the student like a random grab-bag of
topics, consisting of everything that didn't fit in the earlier semesters on mechanics
and electromagnetism. But there is a clear organizing principle for most of what we'll
be studying. It has to do with two surprising facts about time. In particular, one of
these facts leads us to the conclusion that light and matter can't really be made of particles,
as envisioned by Isaac Newton's grand vision of the universe --- they must be made of waves.

<% begin_sec("Time-reversal symmetry",nil,'t-symm') %>

The first of these facts about time is that the laws of physics we have studied so far
never distinguish the past from the future.  We can take a video of
the football pass in figure \figref{football-causality}, reverse it in
time, and then check the motion of the ball to see if it still
complies with Newton's laws. It does. Mathematically, this is because
Newton's laws predict accelerations, and since acceleration is a
second derivative, $\der^2 x/\der t^2$, it doesn't change when we
mirror-image the $x(t)$ graph, interchanging the positive and negative
$t$ axes. For example, a negative second derivative means that the
graph is concave down, and it's still concave down after we
mirror-image it.\index{time!symmetry of the laws of physics under reversal}

This time-reversal symmetry also holds for electromagnetism. As a
simple example, Gauss's law tells us, in the special case of an
electric field in a vacuum, that the field lines can't begin or end at
a point.  (They can only begin or end on charges, whch don't exist in
a vacuum.) This law doesn't even refer to time explicitly, so clearly
nothing goes wrong if we reverse time. Some of the other
electromagnetic quantities, such as currents, reverse themselves in a
time-reversed world, but this can all be handled in a consistent way,
if we adopt certain rules for which things flip and which ones don't.
For an example in the same spirit as the football pass, we can reverse
the current through an electromagnet. The magnetic field reverses
itself, but the time-reversed version of the experiment still
satisfies the rules we've learned about electromagnetism.

The mystery, then, is why there are certain phenomena that, unlike the
football pass or the electromagnet, seem impossible to act out in reverse.
The concrete sidewalk in front of my house was wet when it was first
poured. Then the concrete hardened. When it rains, the
concrete doesn't reverse the chemical reaction and become soft again,
nor will it do so even if I apply some heat, although it would be
consistent with conservation of energy if it did so.

There are many other phenomena that are irreversible. Candles don't
unburn.  Eggs don't unscramble.  We can't remember what the stock
market will do tomorrow. Any one of these could be used to define an
``arrow of time,'' e.g., the future is the direction in which there
are more scrambled eggs and fewer unscrambled ones. All of these
arrows of time seem to be consistent with each other, which suggests
that they have some common underlying explanation. But this
explanation does not seem to be in the laws that govern atoms and
light waves.\footnote{There is one obscure instance in nuclear physics in which
the basic laws \emph{do} violate time-reversal symmetry, but as far as we
can tell this has nothing to do with all the other phenomena, which don't
involve this very specific type of nuclear decay.} We will see in our study of \emph{thermodynamics}, later
in this course, that the explanation comes from statistics and cosmology.

The second of our two strange facts about time relates directly to our upcoming topic of waves, and it
also forms the basis for our discussion of relativity, which will be a thread running through the whole course.
A colorful experiment demonstrating this fact was done by
Hafele and Keating in 1971 (figure \figref{hk-in-cabin}).\index{Hafele-Keating experiment}\index{atomic clock}\label{hafele-keating}
The two
physicists brought atomic clocks with them on round-the-world flights
aboard commercial passenger jets, then compared the clocks with other
clocks that had been left at home. When the clocks were reunited, they
\emph{disagreed} by $\sim 100\ \zu{ns}$. The results were consistent
with Einstein's 1915 theory of relativity, and were interpreted as a
combined effect from motion and gravity. Because it's difficult to
move a clock very fast without putting it on an airplane, it wasn't
until 2010 that Chou \emph{et al.}\footnote{Science 329 (2010) 1630}
succeeded in carrying out a conceptually simpler tabletop experiment
in which a clock was simply moved around (at speeds on the order of 10
m/s) without taking it to high elevation, thus isolating the effect of
motion from the gravitational effect. It is the effect of motion that
will be of interest to us here.


It would be natural to try to explain this effect of motion as
arising from the clocks' sensitivity to noise, cabin pressure, or
vibration. But exactly the same effect is observed with other,
completely different types of clocks under completely different
circumstances, and even with processes such as the decay of elementary
particles moving at high speeds --- the radioactive half-life is
prolonged if the particles are in motion. 

The conclusion is that \emph{time itself} is not absolute.\index{time!not absolute}
If we synchronize two clocks side by side, then move them in different ways, and
finally reunite them, we will in general see that they disagree. In experiments
of this type, we find that time interval is greatest for a clock that moves
\emph{inertially}, i.e., without accelerating. Any other motion results in a smaller
time. The direction of the effect is easily remembered by thinking of the Planet of the Apes
movies, in which human astronauts return to earth and find themselves in a distant
future, in which chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans have dominion over the
planet. \emph{Less} time passes for the astronauts, who undergo the violent accelerations
of space travel.

Mechanical clocks can be affected by motion. For example,
it was a significant technological achievement to build a
clock that could sail aboard a ship and still keep accurate
time, allowing longitude to be determined. How is this
similar to or different from relativistic time dilation?

<% begin_sec("Spacetime",nil,'spacetime') %>

We can visualize what's going on using \emph{spacetime diagrams} like the ones 
in figure \figref{spacetime-cow-car-and-ball}. In \subfigref{spacetime-cow-car-and-ball}{1},
we follow the soccer ball's motion as we go up the page. It moves to the right, is decelerated
by the frictional force from the grass, and comes to a stop. This is essentially a graph of
the ball's position as a function of time, but tilted sideways. The graph is curved, which
shows that the ball's motion is noninertial.

%>

Aristotle would have accepted figure \subfigref{spacetime-cow-car-and-ball}{2}, but
not \subfigref{spacetime-cow-car-and-ball}{3}, which is drawn in the driver's
frame of reference, according to which the cow and the landscape are moving to the
left. Aristotle believed in the absolute nature of notions such as distance and
whether or not two events happen in the same place. Galileo taught us that these
things are relative rather than absolute. Looking at the initial and final images of the car,
we can't necessarily say how far apart in space they are from each other.
According to \subfigref{spacetime-cow-car-and-ball}{2}, they're several meters apart,
but \subfigref{spacetime-cow-car-and-ball}{3} says they're in the same place.

Einstein extended this relativeness to time as well. 
We accept Einstein's view because of evidence such as the atomic clock
experiment described on p.~\pageref{hafele-keating}. We will see shortly that
relativity makes different observers disagree not just on the lengths of time
intervals, as shown in the atomic clock experiment, but also on whether or not two things happen simultaneously.
What Galileo did to the notion of ``same place,'' Einstein did to ``same time.''

One of the reasons that nineteenth-century Europeans found Marxism alarming was because it
was atheistic, and they felt that without the framework of religion, there could be no basis
for morality. For similar reasons, I was deeply disoriented when I first encountered relativity.
The idea had been firmly inculcated that the universe was described by mathematical functions,
and the natural habitat of those functions was graph paper. The graph paper provided what seemed
like a necessary framework. For a position-time graph, the vertical lines meant ``same time,''
and the horizontal ones ``same place.'' Somehow it didn't bother me much when Galileo
erased the same-place lines (or at least relegated them to subjectivity), but without the same-time
lines I felt lost, as if I were wandering in a landscape of Hieronymus Bosch's hell or
Dali's melting watches.

One of the disorienting things about this vision of the universe is that it takes away the notion
that we can have a literal ``vision'' of the universe. We no longer have the idea of a
snapshot of the landscape at a certain moment frozen in time. The sense of vision is merely
a type of optical measurement, in which we receive signals that have traveled to our eyes
at some finite speed (the speed of light). What relativity substitutes for the Galilean
instantaneous snapshot is the concept of \emph{spacetime}, which is like the graph paper
when its lines have been erased. Every point on the paper is called an \emph{event}. How can we
even agree on the existence of an event, or define which one we are talking about, if we can't
necessarily agree on its time or position? The relativist's attitude is that if a firecracker
pops, that's an event, everyone agrees that it's an event, and $x$ and $t$ coordinates are just
an optional and arbitrary name or label for the event. Labeling an event with coordinates is like
God asking Adam to name all the birds and animals: the animals weren't consulted and didn't care.

%       and every bird of the sky, and brought them to the man to see what he would call

My grandparents' German shepherd lived for a certain amount of time, so he was
not just a pointlike event
in spacetime. We know how to represent the motion of such things
as curves on an $x$-$t$ graph. From the point of view of relativity, the curve \emph{is} the thing ---
we make no distinction between the dog and the dog's track through spacetime. Such a track is called
a \emph{world-line}.\index{world-line} A world-line is a set of events strung together continuously:
the dog as a puppy in Walnut Creek in 1964, the dog dozing next to the TV in 1970, and so on. The
strange terminology is translated from German, and is supposed to be a description of the idea that
the line is the thing's track \emph{through} the world, i.e., through spacetime.


Sometimes if we want to describe an event, we can describe it as the beginning or end of a world-line:
the dog's birth, or the firecracker's self-destruction. More commonly, we pick out an event of interest
as the intersection of two world-lines, as in figure \figref{cell-phone-signal-sideways}. In this figure, as is
common in relativity, we omit any indications of the axes, since the idea is that events and world-lines
are primary, and coordinates secondary. In this book we will use the convention that
time progresses from the bottom of the diagram to the top, which means that a spacetime diagram is
turned sideways compared to a graph of $x(t)$. This is the standard convention in relativity.

Suppose that a clock has an inertial world-line that extends from event A to event B, as in figure \figref{interval}. Given A and B,
there is only one possible motion for the clock, because two points determine a line in spacetime, just
as in Euclidean geometry. On a spacetime diagram, we have a line segment AB, and the clock gives us
a measure of how ``long'' this line segment is.
We define the spacetime interval $\interval$ (script ``I'') as
\begin{equation*}
  \interval^2 = (\text{time elapsed on clock})^2.
\end{equation*}
The squares may seem unnecessary. But without them, we would be defining a quantity that had a plus or
minus sign, depending on whether B was after A or before. As we've seen in section
\ref{sec:t-symm}, the laws of physics don't actually define what is the past and what is the future,
so if we are only given the world-line AB, we don't expect to be able to say whether it measures up as positive or negative.
The equation only defines the absolute value of $\interval$, not its sign, which kind of makes sense.
We'll see later that other things also come out simpler with this style of definition.


Now let's see how this plays out in a semi-realistic context. Figure \subfigref{hafele-keating-and-simplification}{1}
shows the general idea of how the experiment on p.~\pageref{hafele-keating} was done. There were three sets of
atomic clocks. Some stayed in the lab, on the surface of the earth, while others went around the world, either to
the east or to the west, while the planet spun on its axis. That's pretty complicated, so let's consider the
simplified version in figure \subfigref{hafele-keating-and-simplification}{2}.
One clock moves inertially while the other does an out-and-back trip. The diagram is drawn in the frame of reference
of the laboratory where the first clock remains. The result is a diagram that looks like a triangle

Now suppose, as in figure
\figref{hafele-keating-triangle},
that the distance traveled by the plane, as measured in the lab frame, is $d$. The time measured by the lab clock
over the bottom half of the diagram is $t$. There will be some spacetime interval $\interval$ measured by the
flying clock during this half of its journey.

Although the slanting world-line with $\interval$ written next to it looks longer than the one with $t$ next
to it, we actually have $\interval<t$. If time worked the way Galileo and Newton believed it did, then
we would simply have $\interval=t$. Keep in mind that this is basically just an $x(t)$ graph, and diagonal
distances measured literally on such a graph never actually mean anything. If it helps your intuition, you can
think of the line segments as roads, and the quantities $t$ and $\interval$ as indications of how many gas stations
you pass on those roads. In this particular diagram, the longer road just happens to have fewer gas stations.

<% marg(300) %>
<%
  fig(
    'hafele-keating-triangle',
    %q{Time dilation in the atomic clock experiment.}
  )
%>
<% end_marg %>


The fact that $\interval$ is less than $t$ is referred to as time dilation. We say that time dilation is
a ``relativistic'' effect, meaning an effect that nobody expected until Einstein's theory of relativity
came along.

Now we expect, for the reasons discussed above, that things will
come out nicer if we talk about $\interval^2$ and $t^2$ rather than $\interval$ and $t$. We
also know that $\interval^2$ will be at its greatest when $d=0$. In general, when we look at
any smooth function near a maximum, we expect it to look like a concave-down parabola, so we should have
\begin{equation*}
  \interval^2 \approx t^2 - (\text{const.})d^2.
\end{equation*}
We happen to have had the historical hindsight to have known that it would be more convenient in the long run
to express this in terms of the squares, but as long as $d$ is small, that's not a substantive assumption whose failure
would invalidate the approximation. We would just have an equation analogous to this one, but without the squares on
$\interval$ and $t$, and with a different value for the constant.

<% self_check('interval-d-zero-and-neg',<<-'SELF_CHECK'

Does this make sense? What about $d<0$?

<% end_sec('interval') %>

<% begin_sec("The correspondence principle",nil,'correspondence-principle') %>

Now what is this mysterious constant in our equation for $\interval$? One thing we can tell is that it must be very small when
written in everyday units, because
we don't notice these relativistic effects on time in everyday life.
Furthermore, the units of the variables occurring in the equation show that the constant
must also have units of $\sunit^2/\munit^2$, or one over velocity squared. In other words, we could write it as
$1/c^2$, where $c$ is some universal constant that has units of speed. The velocity of the plane, relative to the
lab, is $d/t$, and so we can say that relativistic effects are small when the velocities are small compared to $c$.

It makes sense that relativistic effects like time dilation are small in everyday life.
Newton's laws have already been thoroughly tested by experiments under a wide variety of conditions,
so a new theory like relativity must agree with Newton's to a good approximation, within the Newtonian theory's
realm of applicability. This requirement of backward-compatibility is known as
the \emph{correspondence principle}.\index{correspondence principle!for time dilation}\index{correspondence principle!defined}
Newton lived in an era when the fastest
mode of transportation was a galloping horse, and the best
pendulum clocks would accumulate errors of perhaps a minute over the course of several days.
A horse is much slower than a jet plane, so the
distortion of time would have had a relative size of only $\sim10^{-15}$ --- much smaller than the clocks were capable of detecting.
At the speed of a passenger jet, the effect is about $10^{-12}$,
and state-of-the-art atomic clocks in 1971 were capable of measuring that.
A GPS satellite travels much faster than a jet airplane, and the effect on the satellite
turns out to be $\sim10^{-10}$. The general idea here is that all physical laws are approximations, and
approximations aren't simply right or wrong in different situations. Approximations are better or worse
in different situations, and the question is whether a particular approximation is good enough in a given
situation to serve a particular purpose. The faster the motion, the worse the Newtonian approximation of
absolute time. Whether the approximation is good enough depends on what you're trying to accomplish.
The correspondence principle says that the approximation must have been good enough to explain
all the experiments done in the centuries before Einstein came up with relativity.

We have only given an argument that our equation for the interval should be valid for small velocities, but in fact
experiments show that it is valid at all speeds,\footnote{This also ends up being necessary to make the theoretical
framework fit together. See p.~\pageref{lorentz-interval-consistency}.} so we have
\begin{equation*}
  \interval^2 = t^2 - \frac{d^2}{c^2}.
\end{equation*}
One thing we can see from this equation is that something goes very wrong if the speeds get too high.
If a clock could travel faster than $c$, then we would have $d=vt>ct$, and the right-hand side would
be negative. The interval would then be the square root of a negative number, which wouldn't seem to
make sense. This suggests that $c$ can be interpreted as a sort of universal speed
limit for the motion of any material object. For something moving exactly at $c$, we have $\interval=0$
between any two points on its world-line.
<% end_sec('speed-limit-c-theory') %>

<% begin_sec("Experimental evidence",nil,'speed-limit-c-exp') %>
Experiments confirm this. As with the Hafele-Keating airplane experiment, the best educational example
is neither the first historically nor the latest and most recent one. The clearest example I know of was
done by Bertozzi in 1964.\footnote{Bertozzi, "Speed and kinetic energy of relativistic electrons," Am.~J.~Phys. 32 (1964) 551}
Figure \figref{electrons-limiting-speed} shows his data, supplemented by some
data at lower speeds from a later, similar experiment.\footnote{Marvel and Jolivette, open access
at \url{arxiv.org/abs/1108.5977}} If you find this kind of thing mind-blowing or hard to believe, you
may find it interesting to watch the half-hour educational video made by Bertozzi, in which every part of the
experimental setup is demonstrated and explained.\footnote{\url{https://tinyurl.com/bertozziexperiment}}

This experiment directly acts out a scenario often proposed by beginners at relativity who find this
sort of thing paradoxical. Suppose we use a force to accelerate an object such as a spaceship to a speed very close to $c$,
say 99.999\% of $c$. Then we keep on applying the force for a little longer. Doesn't the object go faster than $c$?
Doing anything like this with a human-scale object like a spaceship is impractical because of the vast amounts
of energy that would be required (problem \ref{hw:enterprise-ke-tenth-c}, p.~\pageref{hw:enterprise-ke-tenth-c}).\label{rel-spaceship-impractical}
Bertozzi used electrons. The electrons were accelerated by an electric field $E$ through a distance
$\ell_1$.
Applying Newton's laws
gives Newtonian predictions $a_N$ for the acceleration and $t_N$ for the time
required.\footnote{Newton's second law gives
$a_N=F/m=eE/m$. The constant-acceleration
equation $\Delta x=(1/2)at^2$ then gives $t_N=\sqrt{2m\ell_1/eE}$.}

The electrons were then allowed to fly down a pipe for a further distance $\ell_2=8.4\ \munit$
without being acted on by any force. The time of flight $t_2$ for this second distance
was used to find the final
velocity $v=\ell_2/t_2$ to which they had actually been accelerated.

<%
  fig(
    'electrons-limiting-speed',
    %q{Electrons subjected to a constant force do not have constant acceleration and never surpass $c$.}
  )
%>
<% end_marg %>

Figure \figref{electrons-limiting-speed} shows the results.\footnote{To make the
low-energy portion of the graph legible, Bertozzi's highest-energy
data point is omitted.}
According to Newton, an acceleration $a_N$ acting for a time $t_N$ should produce a final velocity
$a_N t_N$. The solid line in the
graph shows the prediction of Newton's laws, which is that a constant force exerted steadily over
time will produce a velocity that rises linearly and without limit.

The experimental data, shown as black dots, clearly tell a different story. The velocity never goes
above a certain maximum value,
which we identify as $c$. The dashed line shows the predictions of special relativity (ch.~\ref{ch:rel-dynamics}), which
are in good agreement with the experimental results.

As another example of the kind of experimental work that has tested relativity's claims about $c$,
there was a dramatic incident in 2011 in which particle physicists believed
they had detected signals at a laboratory near Rome that had been emitted in
an accelerator experiment in the Alps at a distance of 731.296 km (measured with GPS), and that these signals
had arrived with a time delay of 2.43928 ms. The speed implied by these measurements
exceeded $c$ by 0.002\%. Although this might seem like only a tiny discrepancy, the
theory it violated had by then been so firmly established by decades of
experiments that the claim set off a frenzy of theoretical and experimental
work to try to disprove it, explain it, or use it as evidence for new theories
of physics. A year later, the scientific collaboration that had found the
observed result announced publicly, and with considerable embarrassment, that
they had found the result to be due to two mistakes: a loose cable and a faulty
electronic clock.\label{cern-debacle}

<% begin_sec("Invariance of c",nil,'speed-limit-c-invariant') %>
Based on your knowledge of physics according to Galileo and Newton, you might think that it would
not make sense for there to be a universal constant that was interpreted as a velocity, since
velocities have different values depending on one's frame of reference. We'll take this up
in more detail in sec.~\ref{subsec:einstein-motorcycle}, p.~\pageref{subsec:einstein-motorcycle}, but
basically the straight addition of velocities in relative motion turns out to be a low-velocity approximation.
At high velocities this addition rule becomes inaccurate, and as we approach $c$ it breaks down completely.
(For more detail on this, see sec.~\ref{subsec:combination-of-vel}, p.~\pageref{subsec:combination-of-vel}.)

We describe this by saying that $c$ is \emph{invariant}, i.e., it is the same in all frames of reference. Another good example
of an invariant quantity is electric charge: if charge were not invariant, then, for example, the hydrogen atom
would not be electrically neutral, as we observe it to be in experiments. The interval $\interval$ is also
invariant, because it's defined with reference to an actual measuring device: a clock that travels along a certain
world-line. If the clock is, for example, an hourglass, then every observer is forced to agree that at event
A the sand was all still in the top, and at event B the last grain fell down to the bottom.

In the logical framework used by Einstein in his original 1905 paper on relativity, the invariance of $c$ is
one of the two basic postulates that he uses as logical foundations to derive everything else. If we instead
take it as a postulate that the interval is invariant and behaves according to $\interval^2=t^2-d^2/c^2$, then
something moving at $c$ has $\interval=0$, and since $\interval$ is invariant, we reach the same conclusion that motion at $c$ is
an invariant fact.

<% begin_sec("Speed of light",nil,'speed-limit-c-light') %>
 In SI units,
this maximum speed 
has the numerical value of about $3.0\times10^8\ \munit/\sunit$.
We often refer to it as the speed of light, since visible light
travels at $c$.  Light is a wave disturbance in the electric and
magnetic fields, and the visible spectrum from red to violet
constitutes one part of a much larger electromagnetic spectrum, which
includes phenomena as apparently disparate as radio waves and x-rays.
Different parts of the spectrum are distinguished either by their
frequency (the number of vibrations per unit time) or, equivalently,
by their wavelength (the distance between successive wave crests).
Fundamentally, it's best to think of $c$ not as the speed of light but
as a speed limit, or as a sort of conversion
factor between time and space units.\index{light!electromagnetic wave}\index{light!speed}

we can save work by using a system of units in which the units of time and distance are the same.
As an example, astronomers often use the year as the unit of time, and the light-year as their measure of distance.
A light-year is the distance traveled by light in one year.
The distance from the sun to the nearest star is about four light-years. In these units, $c$ equals 1 ---
one light-year per year. In these units, our equation for the spacetime interval is simply
\begin{equation*}
  \interval^2 = t^2 - d^2,
\end{equation*}
which is a lot simpler than the form of the equation we were writing before.
We don't have to use light-years and year. For example, we could also use seconds and light-seconds,
or, to better than 2\% precision, feet and nanoseconds. Units in which
$c=1$ are called \emph{natural} units.\index{units!natural relativistic}\index{natural units}\label{natural-units}
In natural units, velocities are always unitless. For example, $v=0.5$ means a velocity equal to half the
speed of light.

Using natural units for relativity is, well, natural. Because spacetime doesn't have natural ``graph-paper lines''
built in, space and time aren't completely separate from each other in relativity. That's why we talk about
``spacetime'' instead of just ``space and time.'' There is a good analogy with our energy units. James Joule demonstrated
with a paddlewheel experiment in 1876 that heat and mechanical work were things that could be converted into each
other. We would say today that they are both measures of energy, and we would use units of joules for both.
Given this insight, it would be masochism to keep on using different units for the different types of energy.

Written in the natural-units form $\interval^2 = t^2 - d^2$, our equation for the interval looks very much like the
Pythagorean theorem, and it does a similar job: measuring ``how far'' two points are. The only difference in the
forms of the equations is the minus sign. Using different units for $t$ and $d$ would be like going out to survey
a plot of land and using different units for east-west and north-south coordinates.

Even if we intend to use data expressed in SI units,
often it is easier to do all of our algebra in natural units, which are simpler because $c=1$, and
all factors of $c$ can therefore be omitted. Then at the very end we reinsert factors of $c$ so that the
units make sense in SI.

\begin{eg}{Motion of a ray of light}\label{eg:natural-to-si}
\egquestion The motion of a certain ray of light is given by the equation $x=-t$. Is this expressed in
natural units, or in SI units? Convert to the other system.

\eganswer The equation is in natural units. It wouldn't make sense in SI units, because we would have
meters on the left and seconds on the right. To convert to SI units, we insert a factor of $c$ in the only
possible place that will cause the equation to make sense: $x=-ct$.
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}{Planet of the Apes}\label{eg:natural-to-si-2}
\egquestion In the original movie version of \emph{Planet of the Apes}, the human astronauts find that they have
returned to earth after $2.006\times10^3$ years, but the time interval seems to them to have been only 1.5 years.
How fast did their spaceship go?

\eganswer Let $t$ be the time on earth as they do the outward leg of their trip and $\interval$ the time they
experience on this leg. These times are half the quantities for the whole trip. In natural units, we have
$\interval^2 = t^2 - d^2$, so $d=\sqrt{t^2-\interval^2}$, and their speed was $v=d/t$, or
\begin{equation*}
  v = \sqrt{1-\left(\frac{\interval}{t}\right)^2}.
\end{equation*}
If we needed any reminding that this was in natural units rather than SI, we would notice that because
clearly the equation doesn't make sense in SI. The left-hand side would have units of $\munit/\sunit$,
while the right-hand side is unitless. There is only one way to fix the units by inserting factors of $c$,
and that's to write
\begin{equation*}
  v = c\sqrt{1-\left(\frac{\interval}{t}\right)^2}.
\end{equation*}
This is what we would have gotten if we had done the whole calculation in SI, but the algebra would have
been messier. Plugging in numbers, we get $2.9979234\times 10^8\ \munit/\sunit$, which is just a tad
less than $c=2.9979246\times 10^8\ \munit/\sunit$. The numerical result is in fact easier to read and more
informative in natural units: $v=0.99999960$.

Spacetime diagrams are conventionally drawn in natural units, so that motion at $c$ appears as a world-line
with a slope of 1.

Figure \subfigref{twin-symmetry}{1} shows a time-dilation experiment
like the ones we've been considering.\label{twins-speed-limit}
Alice moves inertially on
world-line A, along with her clock, while her twin sister Betty takes
the noninertial path B.  The time elapsed on Alice's clock will be
greater, because her world-line is the inertial one.  But suppose we
focus on the smaller part of spacetime shown in
\subfigref{twin-symmetry}{2}.  During this time, Betty isn't
undergoing any accelerations. \emph{Both} twins' motion is inertial.

Now suppose that during the time shown in \subfigref{twin-symmetry}{2} they pull out their phones and get in contact. We
might imagine that they could now establish whose time was slower than
normal and whose is faster.  Will Alice hear Betty's voice as
slowed-down and Darth Vadery, while Betty complains that Alice sounds
like a chipmunk? But no, this is impossible because of the perfect
symmetry in \subfigref{twin-symmetry}{2}.  Alice is free to choose her
own ship as a frame of reference, in which case she considers herself
to be at rest while Betty moves.  But the situation is completely
symmetrical, so Betty can say the same thing. Because motion is
relative, we can't say who is ``really'' moving and who is ``really''
at rest. And yet they can't both say that the other's time is normal,
because then there would be no way for any discrepancy to accumulate by
the time they were reunited --- as we see in the actual experiment.

One way to try to resolve this paradox would be to give up on the
idea that motion is always relative, which was an assumption that we
had to appeal to explicitly. As described in more detail in sec.~\ref{sec:simult},
p.~\pageref{sec:simult}, this was the consensus when Einstein was
a university student, around 1896. Einstein rejected this idea and retained
as a central pillar of his description of spacetime the idea that motion is
relative. This is why the theory is called \emph{relativity}. The version of
the theory that doesn't include gravity is called special relativity, and the
later version with gravity is general relativity.

In relativity, the key to resolving this paradox is that the description of the
scenario contains a hidden assumption, that communication using cell
phones is instantaneous. It isn't. A cell phone is a kind of radio,
and its signals are encoded as radio waves, which propagate at $c$.

Figure \figref{symmetric-signals} shows what actually happens to Alice and Betty if, for example, one twin makes two hand claps
near her phone, separated by a one-second interval. If the two signals traveled at infinite speed, then
their world-lines would be horizontal --- they would be received at the same time they were sent. But because
they actually travel at $c$, which is finite,
they are sent at one time and arrive at some later time, and
the signals' world-lines have some slope. We use natural units on our diagrams
so that this is a 45-degree angle. We can see on the diagram that when Alice sends the two hand claps, Betty
receives them at times that are spread to more than one second apart, but exactly the same thing happens when
we flip the diagram. The situation is completely symmetric, and each twin perceives the other's transmission as
having been slowed down.

The parable of Alice and Betty shows that logical consistency is preserved --- but \emph{only} if
there is no mechanism for sending signals instantaneously, as in the
``subspace radio'' of the Star Trek universe.
We therefore have an unexpected link between the nature of time and
the way in which fields of force propagate across the universe.
Force laws like Coulomb's law $F=kq_1q_2/r^2$ and Newton's law of gravity $F=Gm_1m_2/r^2$ look like
they imply instantaneous action at a distance. There is no $t$ in either
equation. But this can't be how things actually operate, because it leads
to the paradox of Alice and Betty.

Switching from Star Trek to Star Wars for our metaphors, we find that
if there is a ``disturbance in the force,'' then it must propagate at
some finite speed, like ripples on a pond, figure \figref{ripples}.
This leads us to a far-reaching conclusion: that the universe must
really be made out of waves (or particles that also have wave
properties, as we'll see when we take up our study of quantum physics
at the end of this book).

Mechanical clocks can be affected by motion. For example, it was
a significant technological achievement to build a clock that could sail
aboard a ship and still keep accurate time, allowing longitude to be deter-
mined. How is this similar to or different from relativistic time dilation?

The following paper-and-pencil exercises involve spacetime diagrams.
Tracks on them are called world-lines. As in the other examples in
this book, a time axis is always closer to vertical, and a position
axis closer to horizontal, and natural units are used, so that
the universal speed $c$ is a slope of $+1$ or $-1$.

Draw spacetime diagrams of: (1) a box with a particle bouncing back
and forth inside it, (2) a ray of light being absorbed by a leaf on a
tree, (3) an atomic nucleus splitting up into two parts (fissioning),
(4) a cloud of gas collapsing gravitationally to form our solar system.
