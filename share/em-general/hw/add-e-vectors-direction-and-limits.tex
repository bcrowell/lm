The following point charges are located at the following positions in the Cartesian plane:

\hspace{10mm}\begin{tabular}{rl}
$q$ & at $(0,0)$\\
$q$ & at $(a,0)$
\end{tabular}

Both $q$ and $a$ are positive. (a) Find the direction of the electric field at the point $(a,b)$, where $b$ is positive. State your result as
an angle defined in the usual way, counterclockwise from the x direction.
(b) Show that the units of your answer make sense.
(c) Show that your answer has the correct limiting behavior for $b\rightarrow 0$ and $b\rightarrow\infty$.
