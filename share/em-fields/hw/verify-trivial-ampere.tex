In each example, choose an orientation for the given Amp\`erian surface, and
use the known magnetic field of a long, straight, current-carrying wire to verify Amp\`ere's law.\\
(1) The dark line is the wire, which carries current toward the top of the page. The square is an Amp\`erian surface
in the same plane as the wire. \\
(2) The dot is a wire perpendicular to the page, which carries current coming out of the page.
The Amp\`erian surface consists of two 90-degree arcs of circles centered on the wire, along with two
line segments joining them.
