An electric dipole $\vc{D}$ immersed in an electric field $\vc{E}$
has energy $U=-\vc{D}\cdot\vc{E}$. Suppose that the magnitudes of both
vectors are fixed, but the dipole is free to rotate.  Find the orientation
that would minimize the energy.
% In FAC ex. 11A, #3a does this in the magnetic case.
% Incredibly, students take 20 minutes to discuss this in groups and get
% it wrong.
