The figure shows a circuit
that contains only static electric fields.
Given the first two readings, we want to predict the third one.
Is it $+1$, $-1$, $+5$, or $-5$ V? Explain your answer.

Any of the four given possibilities can be obtained by adding the
voltages, depending on the signs. It matters how the voltmeter is
connected across each component (which side is COM and which is V),
and it also matters that one meter reading is positive and the other
negative. Without specifically discussing those details, there is no
way to determine which answer is correct.
