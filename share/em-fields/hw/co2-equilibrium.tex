A carbon dioxide has a symmetrical, straight shape, with the carbon atom sitting at the midpoint between the
two oxygens. Suppose that we model this as a set of three point charges, like this:
$Q$ --- $q$ --- $Q$.
(a) Find the ratio $q/Q$ that produces a static equilibrium.\answercheck\hwendpart
(b) Show that the total charge is nonzero.\hwendpart
(c) Find the total electrical potential energy.\answercheck\hwendpart

\hwremark{This is not a satisfactory model for several reasons. The $\zu{CO}_2$ molecules
in our environment are normally electrically neutral and are nevertheless stable. The equilibrium
would also be unstable (determinable directly, or from Earnshaw's theorem without the need for
a calculation). This is an example of the fact that classical theories of matter fail, and we need
quantum physics.}
