The figure shows two small inductors, each consisting of
five circular turns of wire. One is would around a cylindrical form,
the other around a toroidal one. The forms may actually be made of
substances with magnetic properties (sec.~\ref{sec:magnetic-materials}, p.~\pageref{sec:magnetic-materials}), but
for the purposes of this problem we will assume that they are magnetically inert
materials such as cardboard or plastic. As in example
\ref{eg:twisted-pair-pickup}, p.~\pageref{eg:twisted-pair-pickup},
analyze the suscepibility of these inductors to interference from
external stray magnetic fields.
