The figure shows three electric fields and a coordinate system.
(The circle with the dot in it means that the $z$ axis points out of
the page, as required in order to make this a right-handed coordinate system.) 
In each case, visualize a curl-meter (p.~\pageref{fig:curlmeter-fac}), apply the right-hand rule,
and describe the curl using the given coordinate
system. Compare.
