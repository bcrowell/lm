The figure shows two proposed versions of
a cross-section of the field of a solenoid.
In one, the interior field is uniform, while in the
other the interior field is uniform in direction but gets more
intense as we get closer to the currents in the walls.
Use Maxwell's equations to prove that one of these is wrong.
