A certain electrical transmission line, shown in cross-section,
consists of two hollow, coaxial pipes. Let $r$ be the distance from
the axis.  The inner pipe is at $r=a$ and the outer at $r=b$. 
The other parts of the transmission line, shown in white, are
insulators and carry no current.
The
inner pipe carries current $I$, and the outer $-I$, i.e., the transmission line
is part of a complete circuit, and the current flows parallel to the axis, out through one
conductor and back through the other.  Find the magnitude of the
magnetic field (a) for $r<a$, (b) for $a<r<b$, and (c) for $r>b$.
