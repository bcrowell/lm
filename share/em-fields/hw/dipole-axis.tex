Example \ref{eg:e-dipole-mid-plane} on p.~\pageref{eg:e-dipole-mid-plane} calculated the field
of a dipole in its mid-plane. (a) Calculate its field at a point on its axis (i.e., the line through the charges), at a distance $r$
from the center ($r>\ell/2$). (b) Show that at large distances your result from part a is approximately proportional to
$1/r^3$, as in the mid-plane.<% hw_hint("dipole-axis") %>
