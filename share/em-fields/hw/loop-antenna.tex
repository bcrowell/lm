Figures \figref{faraday-em-wave} and \figref{loop-antenna} on p.~\pageref{fig:faraday-em-wave}
analyze a loop antenna receiving an electromagnetic wave. In that analysis, the 
wave is propagating along a line in the plane of the loop, and its polarization
is such that the electric field is also in the plane of the loop.\\
(a) Suppose that the direction of propagation is kept the same, but the polarization
is rotated by 90 degrees, so that the electric field is perpendicular to the plane
of the loop, while the magnetic field is in the plane of the loop. Use Faraday's
law to show that the antenna has zero sensitivity to signals with this polarization.\\
(b) Show the same thing by directly considering the expression $\int\vc{E}\cdot\der\bell$
for the circulation of the electric field, which is what is sensed as a voltage
by the television's tuning circuit.\\
(c) Repeat parts a and b for the case where the wave's direction of propagation is
perpendicular to the plane of the loop.
